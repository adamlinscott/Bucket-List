The world is ending and there is only seconds left to live, how do you
spend your last moments? Ticking off your bucket list of course!

The bucket list was made as part of a 48 hour game jam using the unity 
game engine. It consists of multiple minigames shith simplistic keyboard 
and mouse controls. 

Enjoy!
